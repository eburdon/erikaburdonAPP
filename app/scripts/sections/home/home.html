                    I'm a 4th year Software Engineering student from the University of Victoria. I love BIG ideas, and  sitting on the edge of my skill set.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm currently working at an industry-changing startup in Vancouver, BC! In my spare time, I like to rock out to the Killers, flex my tech skills by working on projects, or leave it all behind and go camping.

                <p>
                    If you have a small project or volunteer opportunity, feel free to <a ui-sref="eb.connect">get in touch!</a> I'm looking for a range of projects to contribute to, and to help encourage women and young students to enter the STEM fields.

                This is my full stack playground! For both pieces, I've keeping a strong focus on good coding practicies, especially TDD, good performance, flexibility and maintenance. <strong>Front end:</strong> I've focused on good, minimal, and mobile-first UI styling. It's built with AngularJs, and uses Sass and Foundation for Apps. <strong>Back end:</strong> Primary language is Scala, but I'm tinkering with and will be including other languages such as Haskell, C, and Go. <strong>Hosting:</strong> FE is hosted statically using AWS S3 services, while the BE is running off its own instance. I hope to implement a minature micro-service architecture, with some components running independently on Amazon Lambda.

                Creating open-source scripts that can analyze a user's Facebook data. Only users can download their information and execute this script. The FB data set includes information such as photo and message  metadata from the day they opened an account in an easy-to-parse XML format.  The first iteration of this project is to analyze their message history. This is written in Go, and distributes the workload via a MapReduce implementation. Data is stored and accessed using an efficient Prefix Trie. The final output is a pie chart of their most active hours. Future work includes further partitioning and distribution of the workload, migrating the Python parser to Go, and further message analysis such as most active day of the week, month, year, etc.

                    At SKIO, I took on a full-stack software development role with tasks such as data mangement (with AWS, Postgres, and scalability considerations), unit testing and continuous integration, and contributing to a robust transactional email framework. I started here as a co-op student, but was brought on full time while finishing my degree in Software Engineering.

                    TUD offered me my first international experience, and I was brought on as a co-op student to assist a team of graduate students on their research project. Their tool addresses topics such as Story Driven Modeling (SDM) and Triple Graph Grammars (TGGs). I contributed by drafting a 7-part tutorial handbook, extending Eclipse plug-ins that worked with the tool, and co-hosting a workshop (English only). Everything's published online, and you can find my work on their research page.
