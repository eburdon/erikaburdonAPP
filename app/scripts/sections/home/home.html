                    I'm a 4th year Software Engineering student from the University of Victoria, and I love sitting on the edge of my skill set. I'm currently working at an industry-changing startup in Vancouver, BC! In my spare time, I like to rock out to the Killers, flex my tech skills, or leave it all behind and go camping.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you have a small project or volunteer opportunity, feel free to get in touch! I'm looking for a range of projects to contribute to and to help encourage women and young students to enter the STEM fields.

                <p>
                    This is my full stack experimental playground! For the front end, I've tried to focus on good design and awesome UI, keeping mobile layouts a priority. It's built with Angular! It also uses Sass and Foundation for Apps. I'm focusing on following good coding practices, particularly flexible and easy-to-maintain components, as well as clear code and good performance.

                </div>
                <p>

                    The back end's primary language is Scala, but I'm tinkering with other languages such as Haskell, and trying to use Amazon Lambda and other neat-o things sometime soon. But first, I plan to build an Android app that will make real changes to this site - that project will finish my Front End, Back End, and Mobile triangle.

                    At SKIO, I took on a full-stack software development role with tasks such as data mangement (with AWS, Postgres, and scalability considerations), unit testing and continuous integration, and contributing to a robust transactional email framework. I started here as a co-op student, but was brought on full time while finishing my degree in Software Engineering.

                    TUD offered me my first international experience, and I was brought on as a co-op student to assist a team of graduate students on their research project. Their tool addresses topics such as Story Driven Modeling (SDM) and Triple Graph Grammars (TGGs). I contributed by drafting a 7-part tutorial handbook, extending Eclipse plug-ins that worked with the tool, and co-hosting a workshop (English only). Everything's published online, and you can find my work on their research page.
