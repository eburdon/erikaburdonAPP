                <p>
                    I'm a 4th year Software Engineering student from the University of Victoria currently working at an innovative, industry-changing, high-paced startup in Vancouver, B.C. I'm also hard of hearing, so face-to-face or email are my preferred ways to chat.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I really enjoy sitting on the edge of my skill set and taking on new projects. If you're looking for a solution, someone to help you polish off a feature or finish up that odd job, feel free to get in touch! I'm also looking for volunteer opportunities. If you're looking for help with encouraging young students to enter the STEM fields or teaching others about coding and technology, I'd be thrilled to help.

                    This is my full-stack experimental playground. For the front end, I've tried to focus on good design and awesome user interfaces. I've done that by implementing every page completely differently to see what does and doesn't work. The backend / API isn't built yet, but I hope to use Amazon Lambda, a number of different languages, and other neat-o things sometime soon.

                    At SKIO, I took on a full-stack software development role with tasks such as data mangement (with AWS, Postgres, and scalability considerations), unit testing and continuous integration, and contributing to a robust transactional email framework. I started here as a co-op student, but was brought on full time while finishing my degree in Software Engineering.

                    TUD offered me my first international experience, and I was brought on as a co-op student to assist a team of graduate students on their research project. I de- and re-constructed the documentation for their modeling tool including their PDF tutorial, and extended their Eclipse plug-in for using the tool. Everything's published online, and you can find my work on their research page.

                <p>This was a series of events co-hosted by UVic's Women in Engineering and Computer Science and Girl Guides of Canada. Over two months, I visited a number of different Brownies, Guides, and Pathfinder groups. We taught them binary "magic" with a fun card game and challenged them to build a tower out of paper that could support the weight of their leader. We ended the nights with round-table talks about what they know about computers, why they're interested in technology, and what we'd all like to be when we grow up.</p>

                    I'm currently a 4th year Software Engineering student, and I intend to finish my degree while working at SKIO Music. My best courses have consistently been those with a long-term project or deep research. Past courses have included Control Systems and Security Engineering. Upcoming courses include Data Mining, Cluster Computing, and directed studies.
