                    I'm a 4th year Software Engineering student from the University of Victoria. I love big ideas and sitting on the edge of my skill set.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm currently working at an industry-changing startup in Vancouver, BC! In my spare time, I like to rock out to the Killers, flex my tech skills with projects, or leave it all behind and go camping.

                    If you have a small project or volunteer opportunity, feel free to <a ui-sref="eb.connect">get in touch!</a> I'm looking for a range of projects to contribute to, and to help encourage women and young students to enter the STEM fields.

                This is my playground! For front and back, I've kept a strong focus on good coding practicies - especially TDD. I'm also concentrating good performance (hypothetical distribution), flexibility, and maintenance. <strong>Front end:</strong> Redesign in progress. Working towards minimal, mobile-first UI styling. Built using AngularJS, uses Sass and Foundation for Apps. New design will explore react. <strong>Back end:</strong> None implemented: previous versions were either written in Scala (hosted via EC2 instance), or written in Python on the Bottle framework. Will tinker with other languages such as Haskell, C, and Go. <strong>Hosting:</strong> FE is hosted statically using AWS S3 services, while the BE has previously run off its own instance. I hope to implement a micro-service architecture soon using Amazon Lambda.</p>

            <p>Any user can download their personal Facebook data from the settings page. Using this data, this project is a distributed, open-source tool that can analyze a user's Facebook habits based on the messages they've sent to friends.</p>
            <p>The first iteration of this project implemented MapReduce to analyze message history. Written in Go, this distributes and parallelizes processing of their message data since the day they joined Facebook. Data is stored in-memory using an efficient Prefix Trie. The final output is a pie chart of their most active hours.</p>

            <p>The second iteration is a proof of concept that implements a server-based microservice architecture. Users upload their file via this web interface, which triggers pre-processing on an EC2 instance, followed by MapReduce on an EMR cluster, and finally post-processing on the same EC2 instance to generate a png graph. This graph is displayed in-context on the upload page.</p>

            <p>The third iteration hopes to implement a serverless microservice using Amazon Lambda to trigger the EC2 processing and EMR analysis independently.</p>

            <p>There's lots of future work to be done, including: a) more fine-grained analysis such as most active day of the week, month, per year, etc..., b) exploring other data provided in the data set, c) adding fault tolerance.</p>

                Continued work on data mining and software engineering research already done in this field. Tried to improve performance for a new algorithm, a variant of the existing Apriori algorithm standard for calculating frequently co-occurring items in transactions. The new algorithm is an improvement by requiring a 1% support level instead of 5%. This change returns more useful items in a reccommendation system.

                I tried to improve phase input partitioning by implementing a custom CombineInputFormat, RecordReader, RecordWriter, and OutputFormat. If successful, the solution would merge files generated from each map cluster (potentially exponentially larger than others) into one, then resplit evenly onto the next map cluster. This would evenly distribute the workload between servers and improve performance while maintaining a total order.

                    TUD offered me my first international experience, and I was brought on as a co-op student to assist a team of graduate students on their research project. Their tool addresses topics such as Story Driven Modeling (SDM) and Triple Graph Grammars (TGGs). I contributed by drafting a 7-part tutorial handbook, extending Eclipse plug-ins that worked with the tool, and co-hosting a workshop (English only). Everything's published online, and you can find my work on their research page.
