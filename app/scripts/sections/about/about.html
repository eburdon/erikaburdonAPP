                        Graduating April 2017 from the University of Victoria with a Bachelor of Software Engineering, I'm currently working full time at an industry-changing startup in Vancouver, B.C. I'm a little bit front-end, a whole of lot back-end, and have worn a couple of different hats throughout the deployment and system architecture pipelines.

                    <p>
                        I started in computer science by attending various robot and coding events as a young girl. I've since worked internationally in Germany for a research team at one of the leading Universities and returned to Canada to graduate, adopt a dog, and change the world!

                    <p>
                        I love sitting on the edge of my skill set. Check out my <a ui-sref="eb.projects">Projects</a> page to see the latest things I've been working on. In my spare time, I like to work on those, rock out to the Killers, or leave it all behind and go camping in the sun.

                    <p>
                        If you have a small project or volunteer opportunities to encourage young women and students enter Science and Engineering, feel free to get in touch! I'm always looking for a range of projects to contribute to.
