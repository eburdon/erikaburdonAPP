                    At SKIO, I took on a full-stack software development role with tasks such as data mangement (with AWS, Postgres, and scalability considerations), unit testing and continuous integration, and contributing to a robust transactional email framework. I started here as a co-op student, but was brought on full time while finishing my degree in Software Engineering.

                    TUD offered me my first international experience, and I was brought on as a co-op student to assist a team of graduate students on their research project. Their tool addresses topics such as Story Driven Modeling (SDM) and Triple Graph Grammars (TGGs). I contributed by drafting a 7-part tutorial handbook, extending Eclipse plug-ins that worked with the tool, and co-hosting a workshop (English only). Everything's published online, and you can find my work on their research page.
