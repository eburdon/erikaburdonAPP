                        <strong>This is my playground! </strong>I've kept a focus on iteration and good coding standards. Front-end is minimal UI and mobile focused. Built using AngularJS, Sass, and Foundation for Apps. Back-end has switched from Scala onto Python/Bottle, depending on the active project. I hope to play with Haskell, C, and Go. I'm also using several AWS services to host the data and tools. Every couple of months, I come back to clean up some code smells.

                <p>
                    Currently developing a simple Android app that will use a CRUD endpoint (developed as part of this website's API) to manipulate data. This data will be available real-time on this site for viewing and modification. I intend to build using React Native, and may include a button to activate the coffee kettle in the kitchen.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The idea is to let a user enter the ingredients for their meal on Sunday. They would then have either the option to enter another for Monday, or let the app suggest something to make based on similar ingredients. Ideally, this would reduce food wastage by helping home cooks to use all their fresh ingredients within the week. Cilantro, for example, only comes in large bunches. Many recipies only need 2-4 TBSP of the herb. By clustering several recipies that use cilantro within one week, there is a better chance of the remainder not being thrown out.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The first iteration of this project implemented MapReduce to analyze message history. Written in Go, this distributes and parallelizes processing of their data since the day they joined Facebook. Data is stored in-memory using an efficient Prefix Trie. The final output is a pie chart of their most active hours.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The second iteration is proof-of-concept that implements a server-based microservice architecture. Users upload their file via the front-end, which triggers pre-processing on an EC2 instance, followed by MapReduce on an EMR cluster, and finally post-processing on the same EC2 instance to generate a png graph. This graph is displayed in-context on the upload page.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Finally, the third iteration hopes to implement a serverless microservice using Amazon Lambda to trigger the EC2 processing and EMR analysis.

                        I continued work on data mining and software engineering research already done in this field. I tried to improve the performance of a new algorithm, a variant of the existing Apriori algorithm standard for calculating frequently co-occurring items in transactions. The new algorithm is an improvement by requiring a 1% support level instead of 5%. Ultimately, this change returns significantly more useful results for use in, for example, a reccommentation system.

                        My changes included implementing a custom RecordReader, RecordWriter, CombineInputFormat, and custom OutputFormat to merge the results for each Mapping phase into one file to be evenly resplit onto several mappers (while maintaining a global ordering), instead of having several mappers excute on wildly different file sizes. This was done in Java using the Apache Hadoop framework. This project and repository are private.

                        Tinkering with the Arduino Starter Kit and other sensors to build small embedded systems that use the microprocessor. I plan to extend this into a custom smart-mirror project to include more hardware work.
