                    <p>
                        Any user can download their personal Facebook information from the settings page. Using some of this data, this project analyzes their message habits and their top 3 messenger friends.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The first iteration of this project implemented MapReduce to analyze message history. Written in Go, this distributes and parallelizes processing of their data since the day they joined Facebook. Data is stored in-memory using an efficient Prefix Trie. The final output is a pie chart of their most active hours.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The second iteration is proof-of-concept that implements a server-based microservice architecture. Users upload their file via the front-end, which triggers pre-processing on an EC2 instance, followed by MapReduce on an EMR cluster, and finally post-processing on the same EC2 instance to generate a png graph. This graph is displayed in-context on the upload page.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Finally, the third iteration hopes to implement a serverless microservice using Amazon Lambda to trigger the EC2 processing and EMR analysis.

                        I continued work on data mining and software engineering research already done in this field. I tried to improve the performance of a new algorithm, a variant of the existing Apriori algorithm standard for calculating frequently co-occurring items in transactions. The new algorithm is an improvement by requiring a 1% support level instead of 5%. Ultimately, this change returns significantly more useful results for use in, for example, a reccommentation system.

                        My changes included implementing a custom RecordReader, RecordWriter, CombineInputFormat, and custom OutputFormat to merge the results for each Mapping phase into one file to be evenly resplit onto several mappers (while maintaining a global ordering), instead of having several mappers excute on wildly different file sizes. This was done in Java using the Apache Hadoop framework. This project and repository are private.
