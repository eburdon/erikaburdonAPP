                        As part of a research course, teams created an automatic tool, script, or method to investigate a code base to see how it evolved over time. Each product needed to present a textual description and visual result of its findings.<br /><br />

                        In addition to a study on the evolution of Python, my partner and I built a single-page Angular app to unify each team's research into one cohesive tool. It also provided a single place to find resources such as papers and lectures related to the topic. User are able to search for any of the 10 tools - either by codebase or language - and execute them from the app. The complete results would be displayed in-browser.<br /><br />

                        The app and its screenshot tutorial are available on GitHub, but is no longer hosted or maintained.

                        To increase exposure to German while living abroad, I subscribed to a mailing list that sent up to 2 emails per day. The message included a new vocabulary word, its translation, and example sentence in both German and English.<br /><br />

                        I wrote a script to parse each email into a text file to study later, then delete the email from my inbox. Result included a Python GUI to do things such as: enter email login information, select either POP3 or IMAP access to the inbox, and save file location.<br /><br />

                        My first attempt at front end web development! I created a static web page using simple HTML and CSS. The page is hosted on UVic's web space and can still be viewed, but is no longer maintained.
